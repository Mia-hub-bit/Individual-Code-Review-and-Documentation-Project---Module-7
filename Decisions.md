I refactored the original code. Here are my reasons for doing so:


Refactoring Decisions:

I refactored the original do_math_stuff function to make the code cleaner, more Pythonic, and easier for others to understand quickly. I focused on clarity through naming, using a list comprehension, and adding better documentation.

List Comprehensions

I swapped the original procedural for loop (where you initialize a list and then append to it) for a list comprehension. It’s the standard, most concise way to transform a list in Python. 
It shrinks three lines of code into one, making the function's entire purpose—iterating and transforming based on a condition—visible at a glance. It's essentially saying, "Create this new list by applying this rule to every item."

Clarity 

The function name was changed from the vague do_math_stuff to the descriptive transform_integers. We also renamed the input variables in main to things like initial_numbers. 
Descriptive naming is crucial for large projects. It communicates intent immediately. To make this more concrete, I added a comprehensive docstring and type hints. This tells a developer exactly what goes in (list[int]), what comes out, and what the transformation rules are (double evens, triple odds) without them having to read the functional code.
